================================================

This is the WordPress theme for my first personal site - the code is a complete mess and a lot of it is redundant too, and this is my first GitHub repo too so this whole thing is likely about to fall apart...

Anyhoo - all CSS is .scss for the sake of being able to minify with [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/ "CodeKit") (lame, I know), and JS is a bit all over the place, again using CodeKit to compile.

Theme isn't even really a WordPress *theme*, just a set of non-extensible templates custom for my site, whoops. Anyway, it's adapted from [Starkers](http://viewportindustries.com/products/starkers/ "Starkers").
